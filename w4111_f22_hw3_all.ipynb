    "Redundant Array of Independent Disks is a data storage virtualization technology in which multiple hard disks are combined to form one or more logical units to provide redundancy, reliability, and scalability. RAID-0 uses striping so data in RAID level 0 is split equally across all of the disks. The storage capacity is the sum of the capacities of all the disks in the array. The pros of RAID-0 are easy-to-implement, full use of storage capacity, and good performance in read and write operations. The cons of RAID-0 are not fault-tolerant and not ideal for mission critical systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAID-1 uses mirroring with no parity, striping, or spanning of disk space across multiple disks. It is a setup of at least two drives that contain an exact copy or mirror of data. It has pros on fast read operations, high fault tolerance with two disk drives, and data replacement when drive failure. It has cons on high cost, redundant data capacity, and irreplaceable when connected with multiple users.\n",

    "RAID-5 combines block-level striping with distributed parity among drives, which is the most common and secure RAID level. It requires at least 3 drives and can work with at most 16 drives. Data blocks are striped across the disks, and on one disk a parity checksum of all the block data is written. The pros are fast data-read transactions, data accessible after drive failure and during replacement of the failed hard drive. The cons are complex technology to implement, bad effects on throughput, long time to restore or replace data if drive fails."
